1 - The program should receives an string as argument.
2 - In this string there must be patterns representing keys
to be pressed. For example: "ga 'tui' %LSUPER %LSHIFT" where
single letters are single keys and substrings beggining with
percentage are special keys.
3 - Press the corresponding keys.

* I need to learn how to manipulate strings and get substrings.
* Also a thing or two about regular expressions? Maybe...
* I need to learn how to assign for each character a corresponding
  keyboard key code - there are a lot, I believe...
* And finally, I guess it should loop through the string...
